Inspired by [notnites' blog post](https://notnite.com/blog/2024), here's everything of note that I did in the past year:

## January

- I worked on a web app for a friend's pooled COVID testing service, but this fell through.
- As far as I can tell, this is when I started thinking about Alchemy - a project I'll talk about later.
- I played an obscene amount of Celeste and had fun beating the game for the first time.

## February

- I made a [new role bot for the ACM UMN discord][role-bot] in order to replace the old Go code that was hard to extend.
  This one was my first time using Bun, and it was honestly pretty good.
- I started work on a "discord stock exchange bot", which was supposed to be like a little stock trading
  mini-game where you could buy and sell stock in users, but this project got abandoned, mostly because I
  don't know anything about the actual stock market.
- I started helping one of my friends with a game that they were making in Godot, but he abandoned the
  project after a couple weeks.

## March

- I made [another Discord bot][esedur], this time so that my friends who play [Reign 2E][reign] could easily
  roll dice without having to count up all their dice pools.
- I had a lot of fun in my type theory course, but this is about where it really started squishing me into paste.
- I saw [Glass Beach][glass-beach] in concert and met a new friend there :-)

## April

- I made [Kozuka][https://kozuka.kmwc.org], a web app for conlangers to generate words for their languages, because
  Awkwords kept going down and I really don't like the way you can only use capital letters for categories.
- I switched to [NixOS][nixos]! At least, this is when [my flake][snow] got put up on Github. I have really liked Nix
  so far, and I'm pretty glad I'm running it.

## May

- I drove up north and saw the northern lights with my friends :-)
- I significantly reworked my NixOS flake.
- I read [The Gnostic Gospels][gnostic-gospels] by Elaine Pagels and found it really interesting. It's probably the first
  real book I've finished in a long time.

## June

- I started working on the web app for [Game Vault Con][gvc]!
- I played a bunch of XCOM 2.

## July

- I continued work on the Game Vault Con stuff. I think it actually started towards the end of the month? I can't remember.
- I made [anneau][anneau], which is simple webring software. I still need to deploy this.
- I spent a lot of time with my friends :-)
- I visited home for a bit which was alright.

## August

- I moved in with my girlfriend, which genuinely completely fixed my mental health.
- I started working on a Blades in the Dark hack inspired by Disco Elysium, and ended up with a really pretty PDF. The campaign
  so far is fun but it's been on pause with the semester ending and holidays.

## September

- I made [a page][qonk-time] to convert between real-world time and the time system used in a friend's conworld.
  It looks really pretty!
- I tried cloning [tabspace][tabspace] because I don't like their dark mode handling, but I didn't get too far.
- I started making a way to play [Jaipur][jaipur] online with friends. I got kind of stuck with making the AI,
  but I think this was mostly abandoned because me and my girlfriend stopped playing Jaipur as much.

## October

- I made the [garden][garden], a fork of jzhao's Quartz, which I still need to deploy. It's intended to be a space for
  me to dump my Obsidian notes so that I don't have to spend a bunch of time converting them into real blog posts.
- I made a fun challenge for the ACM UMN CTF, where you have to implement a really weird little Forth.
- I took another crack at developing [Hanas][hanas] but hit a wall when it turned out that Prisma is really slow on
  NixOS for some reason.
- I saw Porter Robinson in concert!

## November

- I made [Hazy][hazy], a new backend for the ACM UMN MinneHack registration system, currently running in production.
- I did a lot of work for my web dev class, including making a really complex commenting system.
- I started working on a SillyTavern-like project where the frontend looks like Discord, but I never really finished it.

## December

- I started working on another compiler... It's not done yet, but it'll be for Alchemy.
- I did a little bit of Advent of Code but did not finish, not even close. Finals really hit :(
- I made this blog!
- I made my post about ergativity!
- I went to the Machine Girl show and had a great time.
- My fursona commission came in! I still need to fix up the background a little bit but I love it.

## For 2025

I wanna do more projects! I wanna get further with Alchemy (this is the first time I've gotten farther than parsing
in writing a programming language), and ideally I'd like to finally get some more work done with Hanas.
Next year is also the year I finally graduate from college, so I'll be needing to find a job - we'll see exactly where
that leads. I'm excited for 2025!
